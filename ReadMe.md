R offers a wide range of graphical and statistical tools, including time-series analysis, classification, clustering, and linear and nonlinear modeling. This workshop introduces R to those who have had little to no prior experience. Topics include: 1) an overview of basic R; 2) data structure of R; 3) data management of R; and 4) some useful package of R. A real-life sports dataset will be used to provide a better understanding of R.
